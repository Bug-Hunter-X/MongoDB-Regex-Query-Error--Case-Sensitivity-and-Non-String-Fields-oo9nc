```javascript
const query = { field: { $regex: /pattern/ } };
const result = await collection.find(query).toArray();
```
This code attempts to perform a regular expression match on a field, however if the field is not of String type, it would lead to error.  Another problem is that the regex is case sensitive and may not match all expected results.
